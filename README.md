Let's catch them all, shall we?

## How to use my website (FOR USERS THAT WOULD GO TO MY WEBSITE FOR THE FIRST TIME):
- Step 1: Going to the link published in GitHub would bring you to the Debug Menu by default (index.html).
- Step 2: Clicking any button would redirect you to the Login Page.
- Step 3: Click the link in that page to Register.
- Step 4: Register using any email and any password you like (at least 8 characters would do).
- Step 5: After registering, it would bring you to the Home Page and feel free to explore what you can do.

### After register (if users go back to the debug menu):
- Clicking any of the options would actually now go to that page since you are already logged in.
- Clicking the Log In on the debug menu would bring you to the login page. There you can try if your entered email and password will work.

## Limitations to my website:
- Not a fully functional website, just a demo on how it would work.
- Profile name would be defaulted to Phantom (My gamer name). Although, you can change that on the Trainer Card Page.
- Some JavaScript functions are not added since I want to keep it simple and not complicate the idea.
- Hamburger menu not added because I want to imitate a social media sidebar (quick navigation bar).
- Does not have any server to connect to so all forms are for testing and are safe.
